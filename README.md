# Evolving-Role-of-HRM-Towards-Environmental-Performance---Data-Analysis-using-Python

INTRODUCTION
Organizations have been forced to re-evaluate their operational strategies and practices in recent years due to the increased emphasis on sustainability, especially in the area of human resource management (HRM). It is becoming more widely acknowledged that HRM plays a crucial role in advancing environmental performance and cultivating a sustainable culture in businesses. The goal of this study, "Evolving Role of HRM Towards Environmental Performance," is to investigate the complex connections between different HRM practices and how they affect sustainable performance results. Sustainable Performance, HRM practices, employee behavior, organizational culture, self-efficacy, and environmental performance are just a few of the factors that are included in the dataset used for this study and are essential to comprehending this link. We aim to gain a better understanding of how effective HRM practices could support an organization's environmental sustainability initiatives by looking at all of these elements.

Through comprehensive data analysis, including correlation assessments and visualizations, this research will illuminate the pathways through which HRM can influence sustainable performance. Finally, our
goal is to show that companies may improve their environmental performance and cultivate a more engaged and accountable staff by coordinating HRM strategies with sustainability objectives.
